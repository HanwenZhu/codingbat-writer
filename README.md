# CodingBat Writer
Code that writes code for https://codingbat.com/python.

Usage:
```sh
python3 main.py [<url>]
```

## How It Works
When writing code on CodingBat, it lets you see *some* of the test data.  This is used as the training data of a neural network using ``tensorflow.keras``.  Then the code for feed-forward (matrix multiplication, etc.) in pure Python is uploaded.
